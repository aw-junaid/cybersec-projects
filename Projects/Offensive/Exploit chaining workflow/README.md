# Exploit Chaining Workflow

## What the Tool is For:
An automated framework for creating, testing, and executing multi-step exploit chains that combine vulnerabilities to achieve deeper network penetration, privilege escalation, or specific objectives.

## About:
Exploit chaining involves combining multiple vulnerabilities and techniques in sequence to achieve a goal that wouldn't be possible with individual exploits alone. This tool automates the workflow for complex attack chains.

## General Algorithm:
```
1. Vulnerability Mapping & Analysis
   - Identify potential entry points
   - Map attack surface
   - Analyze vulnerability relationships

2. Chain Construction
   - Define exploit sequence
   - Handle dependencies
   - Manage payload delivery

3. Execution Automation
   - Sequential exploit execution
   - Conditional branching
   - Error handling and recovery

4. Post-Exploitation Automation
   - Privilege escalation
   - Lateral movement
   - Persistence establishment

5. Reporting & Analysis
   - Chain success/failure tracking
   - Execution timeline
   - Lessons learned
```

## How to Run the Code:

### Python Version:
```bash
# Run web application chain
python3 exploit_chaining.py --target 192.168.1.100 --chain web

# Run lateral movement chain
python3 exploit_chaining.py --target 192.168.1.100 --chain lateral

# Run privilege escalation chain
python3 exploit_chaining.py --target 192.168.1.100 --chain privilege

# List available chains
python3 exploit_chaining.py --list-chains
```

### C Version:
```bash
# Compile
gcc -o exploit_chaining exploit_chaining.c

# Run
./exploit_chaining
```

## Example Chain Configurations:

### Web Application Chain:
```json
{
  "chain_name": "Web App to Domain Admin",
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "SQL Injection",
      "technique": "sql_injection",
      "payload": "web_shell",
      "prerequisites": []
    },
    {
      "name": "Web Shell Access", 
      "technique": "file_upload",
      "payload": "reverse_shell",
      "prerequisites": ["SQL Injection"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Local Enumeration",
      "technique": "system_enumeration", 
      "payload": null,
      "prerequisites": ["Web Shell Access"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Privilege Escalation",
      "technique": "kernel_exploit",
      "payload": "root_shell",
      "prerequisites": ["Local Enumeration"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Lateral Movement Chain:
```python
# Example lateral movement chain
lateral_chain = ExploitChain("Domain Compromise Chain")

steps = [
    # Initial access through phishing
    # Credential harvesting from workstation  
    # Network discovery
    # Lateral movement to server
    # Privilege escalation on server
    # Domain controller compromise
    # Golden ticket creation
]
```

## Key Features:

1. **Sequential Execution**: Automatically executes steps in order with dependency checking
2. **Conditional Logic**: Steps only execute if prerequisites are met
3. **Error Handling**: Continues or stops based on step success/failure
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors chain execution in real-time
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed execution reports and analytics
6. **Modular Design**: Easy to add new exploits and techniques

## Educational Value:

This framework teaches:
- Attack chain construction and automation
- Vulnerability relationship mapping
- Post-exploitation technique sequencing
- Red team operational security
- Campaign planning and execution
- Defensive chain detection and breaking

## Common Exploit Chain Patterns:

```python
CHAIN_PATTERNS = {
    "web_to_domain": "Web app → Server access → Domain compromise",
    "phishing_to_data": "Phishing → Workstation → Data exfiltration",
    "vpn_to_internal": "VPN access → Internal recon → Lateral movement", 
    "physical_to_network": "Physical access → Network access → Persistence"
}
```

This exploit chaining workflow provides a structured approach to multi-step attack automation while emphasizing the importance of proper authorization and ethical testing practices.
