## How to Use This Network Scanner

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3** installed
2. **Network connectivity** to the target
3. **Permissions** to run network scans

### Basic Usage

1. **Save the script** as `network_scanner.py`

2. **Make it executable** (optional):
   ```bash
   chmod +x network_scanner.py
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python3 network_scanner.py
   ```

4. **Enter the target** when prompted:
   ```
   Enter target IP or hostname: 192.168.1.1
   ```

### Example Output
```
Enter target IP or hostname: scanme.nmap.org

[+] scanme.nmap.org:80 open (HTTP)
[+] scanme.nmap.org:443 open (HTTPS)

  - 80/tcp (HTTP)
  - 443/tcp (HTTPS)

Results saved to scan_report.txt
```

### Target Examples

**Local network devices:**
- `192.168.1.1` (typical router)
- `192.168.1.100` (local computer)
- `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` (your own machine)

**Test servers:**
- `scanme.nmap.org` (authorized test server)
- `google.com`
- `github.com`

### Customizing the Scan

**1. Modify the port list:**
```python
# Add more ports to COMMON_PORTS dictionary
COMMON_PORTS = {
    # ... existing ports ...
    5432: "PostgreSQL",
    27017: "MongoDB",
    9200: "Elasticsearch",
}
```

**2. Adjust timeout (faster/slower scans):**
```python
# In the scan_port function, change timeout value
def scan_port(host, port, timeout=2):  # Increased timeout for unreliable networks
```

**3. Scan specific port range:**
```python
# Replace the thread creation with a range
for port in range(1, 100):  # Scan ports 1-100
    t = threading.Thread(target=scan_port, args=(host, port))
```

### Advanced Usage Examples

**Scan your own machine:**
```bash
python3 network_scanner.py
# Enter: localhost
```

**Scan your router:**
```bash
python3 network_scanner.py
# Enter: 192.168.1.1
```

**Scan a website:**
```bash
python3 network_scanner.py
# Enter: example.com
```

### Important Legal and Ethical Notes

⚠️ **WARNING: Use Responsibly**

1. **LEGAL USE ONLY**: Only scan networks you own or have explicit permission to test
2. **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE**: This tool is for learning about network security
3. **RESPECT LAWS**: Unauthorized scanning may be illegal in your jurisdiction
4. **START LOCAL**: Practice on your own home network first

**Legal targets for practice:**
- Your own computer (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`)
- Your home router
- Authorized test servers like `scanme.nmap.org`
- Virtual machines on your own network

### Troubleshooting

**"Connection refused" or no open ports:**
- Target may have firewall enabled
- Target may not be running services on scanned ports
- Network connectivity issues

**Slow scanning:**
- Increase timeout value in `scan_port` function
- Check network connection quality

**Permission errors:**
- On some systems, raw socket operations may require admin privileges
- Try running with `sudo` (but be cautious)

**Name resolution errors:**
- Use IP addresses instead of hostnames if DNS issues occur

### Output Files

The script creates `scan_report.txt` with results:
```
scanme.nmap.org:22 open (SSH)
scanme.nmap.org:80 open (HTTP)
scanme.nmap.org:443 open (HTTPS)
```

This scanner provides a basic foundation for understanding network reconnaissance and can be expanded with additional features like service banner grabbing, vulnerability detection, and more comprehensive reporting.
