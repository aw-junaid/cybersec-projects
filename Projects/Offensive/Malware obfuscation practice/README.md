# Malware Obfuscation Practice — Test Packing & Obfuscation Techniques

##  What This Tool Is For

This project provides a **controlled lab framework** to **study and test malware obfuscation** — how code can be packed, encoded, and hidden to evade simple static analysis or signature detection.

⚠️ **Educational Use Only:**
This tool does **not create real malware**. It merely shows **how obfuscation works** on safe sample scripts or strings — for **defensive researchers** to learn detection techniques (e.g., YARA, AV engines, sandbox testing).

## Purpose

* Understand basic **obfuscation mechanisms** (encryption, encoding, packing).
* Learn to **reverse/unwrap** obfuscated samples.
* Analyze performance and detectability in sandboxed environments.
* Demonstrate defensive countermeasures — signature matching, entropy checks, unpacking.

## General Algorithm / Working Logic

## Obfuscation Workflow

1. **Input**: Take a sample benign script or text payload.
2. **Choose Method**: Select encoding/encryption method:

   * Base64 encoding
   * XOR encryption
   * AES/RC4 lightweight encryption (educational)
   * Simple string splitting / packing
3. **Transform**: Apply the selected technique to obfuscate the data.
4. **Generate Output**: Save the obfuscated script/payload.
5. **De-obfuscate (Optional)**: Reverse the process to show recovery.
6. **Analyze in Sandbox**: Observe behavior under dynamic analysis — e.g., detect string entropy, encoded blobs, and runtime decoding.
