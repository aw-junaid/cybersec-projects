# Exploit Template Library — Reusable Exploit Skeletons

## What This Tool Is For

The **Exploit Template Library** is an educational framework that provides reusable templates for writing and testing basic exploits in a **controlled lab** environment.

Its purpose is to help students learn **how exploits are structured** — not to attack real targets — by offering safe skeletons for common vulnerability classes:

* Buffer overflows
* Format string bugs
* Command injections
* Directory traversal
* SQLi/XSS payload generators (for local apps)

It helps you:

* Understand the anatomy of an exploit (setup, payload crafting, delivery, response handling).
* Quickly scaffold new test exploits by filling placeholders.
* Standardize exploit development across lab exercises.

## Algorithm / General Workflow


1. **Initialize Target Info** — IP, port, protocol, and vulnerability type.
2. **Define Payload** — choose or craft the payload:

   * Shellcode (binary payload for buffer overflow).
   * Command string (for injection-based).
   * HTTP/SQL query, etc.
3. **Build Exploit Packet/Request** — combine payload with protocol template (HTTP request, socket data, etc.).
4. **Send Exploit** — open connection, send payload, await response.
5. **Verify Result** — confirm crash, code execution, or response indicator.
6. **Logging** — record exploit details for lab documentation.
7. **Reusable Templates** — saved as `.json` or `.py` (Python) / `.c` (C) skeletons that can be filled in later.
