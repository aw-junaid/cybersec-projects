## How to Run the Code

### Python Version
```bash
# Save as vulnerability_dashboard.py
python3 vulnerability_dashboard.py

# The program will create a vulnerabilities.json file to store data
```

### C Version
```bash
# Save as vulnerability_dashboard.c
gcc -o vulnerability_dashboard vulnerability_dashboard.c
./vulnerability_dashboard

# The program will create a vulnerabilities.csv file to store data
```

## Algorithm Explanation

### General Working Algorithm:

1. **Data Structure**: Uses structured data types (classes in Python, structs in C) to represent vulnerabilities with fields like ID, title, severity, status, dates, etc.

2. **CRUD Operations**:
   - **Create**: Add new vulnerabilities with auto-generated IDs
   - **Read**: Display vulnerabilities with filtering and statistics
   - **Update**: Modify vulnerability status and track changes
   - **Delete**: Implicit through status changes (resolved/false positive)

3. **Persistence**: 
   - Python: JSON file storage
   - C: CSV file storage

4. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Track vulnerability from discovery to resolution
   - Status transitions: New → In Progress → Resolved/False Positive/Risk Accepted

5. **Statistics Generation**:
   - Count vulnerabilities by status and severity
   - Provide overview metrics for management

## About the Tool

### Purpose:
A Vulnerability Management Dashboard is a defensive security tool designed to track and manage security vulnerabilities throughout their complete lifecycle. It helps security teams:

- **Centralize** vulnerability information
- **Track** remediation progress
- **Assign** responsibilities
- **Monitor** SLAs and due dates
- **Generate** reports and metrics
- **Prioritize** based on severity and business impact

### Key Features:
1. **Vulnerability Tracking**: Complete lifecycle management
2. **Status Workflow**: Standardized vulnerability states
3. **Severity Classification**: CVSS scoring and risk prioritization
4. **Assignment & Ownership**: Clear responsibility assignment
5. **Reporting**: Statistics and progress tracking
6. **Audit Trail**: Timestamped status changes

### Real-world Applications:
- Security Operations Centers (SOCs)
- Vulnerability assessment teams
- Compliance and audit departments
- IT risk management
- Penetration testing teams

This tool helps organizations maintain visibility into their security posture and ensures vulnerabilities are properly tracked and remediated according to established policies and timelines.
