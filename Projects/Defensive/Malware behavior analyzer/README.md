# Malware Behavior Analyzer - Behavioral IOC Extractor

## What this tool is for:
This tool analyzes malware samples in a controlled environment to extract behavioral Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). It monitors file system changes, network activity, registry modifications, and process creation to identify malicious patterns.

## Algorithm:
1. **Initial System Snapshot**: Capture baseline state of files, registry, processes, and network connections
2. **Execute Malware**: Run the suspicious sample in a controlled environment
3. **Monitor Activities**: Track in real-time:
   - File system changes (creation, modification, deletion)
   - Registry modifications
   - Process creation and termination
   - Network connections and DNS queries
4. **Post-execution Snapshot**: Capture system state after malware execution
5. **Compare & Extract IOCs**: Identify changes and generate behavioral indicators
6. **Generate Report**: Create comprehensive IOC report


## How to Run the Code

### Python Version:
```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install psutil

# Run the analyzer (USE IN ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT ONLY!)
python malware_analyzer.py /path/to/suspicious_file.exe
```

### C Version:
```bash
# Compile the code
gcc -o malware_analyzer malware_analyzer.c

# Run the analyzer (USE IN ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT ONLY!)
./malware_analyzer suspicious_file.exe /tmp
```

## Important Security Notes:

1. **ALWAYS RUN IN ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT**: Use VM, sandbox, or dedicated malware analysis machine
2. **NETWORK ISOLATION**: Disconnect from production networks
3. **USE SAMPLE FILES ONLY**: Never run unknown malware on production systems
4. **PROPER PERMISSIONS**: Ensure you have appropriate permissions for analysis
